    "# Including WebGL animations\n",
    "\n",
    "WebGL is used for 3D animation, making good use of any graphics acceleration and hardware available to the computer. WebGL is based on OpenGL, a rich graphics language for high performance visualizations. \n",
    "\n",
    "A WebGL-compatible web browser is required, such as FireFox or Safari. As of January 2020, Google Chrome is unfortunately not compatible.\n",
    "\n",
    "> One issue with Chrome is how it deals with \"Cross Origin Resource Sharing,\" which is a question of how it deals with internet security. At the moment (Nov 2020) we still don't know how to work around this problem in Chrome. So considering using Firefox or Safari. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook, is not meant to be an introduction to WebGL. All we do is show how to use it in a Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key is to use HTML magic and iframes to include the notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we need three files to get this to work:\n",
    "\n",
    "- webgl-demo.html (the file that iframe will load)\n",
    "- webgl-demo.js (the javascript that creates the animation)\n",
    "- gl-matrix.js  (some helper code for 3D work)\n",
    "\n",
    "These are all loaded in this repo. \n",
    "\n",
    "The key piece of code to display the animation looks like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "%%html\n",
    "<iframe src=\"webgl-demo.html\" width=\"500\" height=500></iframe>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll run it just below. And further below, I will show you the code in the 3 files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note this code is based on the examples in this repo:  https://github.com/mdn/webgl-examples/tree/gh-pages/tutorial\n"
